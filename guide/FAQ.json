{"Frequency":1,"Category":"RPN","Query":"Could you point me to the documentation for the Look Up RPN data items","Response":"We have not produced a lookup RPN data items document as a lookup RPN request has a very small number of parameters which we do not believe need the business context that the RPN response or payroll submission require. The data item documents are intended to provide a business friendly description and context for non-technical data items."},

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"RPN","Query":"The NewRPN Request/Response does not have 'RangeParameters'/'TotalRPNCount' fields, which LookupRPN has to cater for large batches.","Response":"During our analysis we considered including fields in the New RPN schema to facilitate batching requests in the same way as for a payroll submission however we ultimately decided against it. The purpose of batching a payroll submission is to ensure that Revenue systems can treat an Employer’s Payroll as a single entity in the same way that an Employer sees it. However in the case of a large request of new RPNs we don’t see the functional requirement to treat it as a single request and so think it is safe for the request to be split across multiple NewRPN requests. If an employer needs to request more RPNs than are allowed in a single request (limit yet to be defined) then they can send in multiple separate requests with different request IDs. Each of these requests will be processed independently."},

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Are Agent TAINs allocated to an employer or specific payroll?","Response":"A Tain is a number that is allocated to an agent by Revenue.  The Employer must inform Revenue that the Agent represents them.  This is an existing process that will not change with PAYE Modernisation.The relationship between the agent and the employer is validated with each submission. The number does not change for each payroll submission. "},

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Is the PAYE Modernisation API intended to use either SOAP orJSON","Response":"There will no functional gaps if you use just the JSON API.  The main difference is that the JSON option allows you to send a single compressed Payroll file, whereas with the XML option, large submissions will have to be sent as a batch of files.  The reason for Revenue publishing two different APIs (SOAP/XML) and (REST/JSON) was to allow software providers choose which API best serves their needs."},

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Can I run multiple companies pay runs in the same file?","Response":"You will only be able to make a ‘Look up RPN’ request for a single employer reference number so you should direct your developers to separate each company into different request files (whether XML or JSON)."},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"When will the request/response for a payroll software to receive all data revenue have for a particular payroll be available?","Response":"The response for the ‘CheckPayrollRun’ webservice includes a ‘PayslipSummary’ element which will contain a list of the active payslips and summary information for each payslip (e.g. TaxOnIncome, PRSI, LPT, USC).

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"How will you know which line to delete from which submission?","Response":" A line item ID is a unique reference to a line item across submissions for a given payroll run. A line item that was sent to Revenue on a particular submission can be deleted by sending in a new payroll submission as follows:"},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"","Response":"Include the original payrollRunReference in the header of the Submission"},

When the employer requests a Revenue Payroll Notification (RPN – previously P2C) for this payment, any available credits/rate band will be included on the RPN and allocated to this employment. The credits/rate bands will remain the same unless subsequently changed by the employee.  Once the employment ID is unchanged, Revenue will know that this is the same employment and will not create a new one. "},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"What happens if we are notified late of leavers who have gone AWOL? ","Response":"PAYE Regulations are currently being reviewed and will be amended to provide for PAYE Modernisation. A facility will also be provided in PAYE Services to allow employees to register the cessation of an employment with Revenue. "},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Leaver reinstatements – How should they be dealt with?","Response":"If the employee has not in fact ceased the employment, this should be dealt with as a reporting error correction in the next payroll event.

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"How will Revenue check/match records will it be by Employment ID and PPSN number?","Response":"Revenue will use a combination of the employer number, employee PPSN and employment ID to identify the correct employment."},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"","Response":"The employment ID needs to be unique where the employee has more than one employment with the same employer e.g. A Healthcare provider employs the same person as both a nurse and a carer.  The employment ID would need to be different to distinguish between the 2 employments. The employment ID  would also need to be different where an employee leaves and then re-commences an employment in the same year with the same employer."},

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Would you prefer larger employers to provide you with an XML file?","Response":"We do not have a preference on which file format is used for upload."},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Does the Employer Schema and Employee Schema have to be submitted in separate XML files?","Response":"No. The employee schema is a sequence nested within the employer schemas so they form one file."},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"There is currently no way of getting a list of all PayrollSubmissions or PayrollRuns.  This can lead to orphaned data if the Customer (or ROS) restores/loses data.  ","Response":"We will be providing a ‘Returns Reconciliation’ webservice which when queried will respond with a list of all payroll Run References for the payrolls submitted by an Employer for a specified return period (e.g. January 2019). The ‘Returns Reconciliation’ webservice when used in conjunction with the ‘CheckPayrollRun’ service will provide Employers with a way of retrieving back payslips. However the payslip details will be restricted to the 4 financial figures (Tax on Income, PRSI, USC & LPT) and there will also be a limit on how far back you can query (limit yet to be agreed). At moment we don’t have the specifications for the ‘Returns Reconciliation’ webservice ready for publishing but I will have an update on this at the next PSDA workshop."},

{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Is there a reason to have both InvalidPayslip and PayslipWarning in the CheckPayrollSubmisionResponse?","Response":"We have separated InvalidPayslips and PayslipWarnings in the CheckPayrollSubmissionResponse as they have a different outcomes. An InvalidPayslip has been rejected due a validation error and so will not have been included in the submission summary where as a payslip with a PayslipWarning (e.g. payslip does not refer to the latest RPN) will have been processed and included in the submission summary."},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Would it not be better to use County Codes rather than the full county name?","Response":"We chose to use the ‘full name’ of counties rather than abbreviations to avoid any confusion and as their use in this context is in a technical message rather than on screen we didn’t see any requirement for them to be bilingual. We chose to use ‘ISO 3166-1 alpha-3’ to represent countries we have used this representation before in other revenue systems."},
{"Frequency":1,"Category":"Other","Query":"Can you confirm if the List of Employees should only be extracted for Current employees in the tax year?","Response":"I can confirm that the ‘List of Employees’ should only contain the current employees as of the date of producing the extract.
